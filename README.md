# Python-Generic-CSP-Solver - Alpha Version 0.1
A generic constraint satisfaction problem solver based on Python
## Description
This is a native python-based implementation of a generic CSP solver.
### Algorithms
The Model is configurable to work using the 3 algorithms :
* Backtracking
* Forward Checking
* AC3
### Heuristics
It also includes one heuristic : 
* Minimum Remaining Values
### Genericity
The model is generic, it can hypotheticatlly work on any kind of CSP, all that has to be done is to formalise its constraints
### Built in problems
The implementation has a built in formalization of three problems:
* N Queens
* Map Coloring
* Sodoku
### Input/Output
Input and output can be made curruntly in three ways:
* Console/File
* Console/Console
* Excel/File
### Verbose Mode
The solver contains a **verbose** mode, printing the track of resolution of the problem
### CRYPTARITHMETIC constraints
The solver implements CRYPTARITHMETIC constraints implementation.
## Demo
Demo videos are available in Demo folder
## Use Tutorial
To be added
## Next ?
This implementation has a lot of improvements that have to be done:
* Adding more built in problem types
* Export and impot json formatted data
* Change the implemenation to support degree heuristics
* Implement an interface for the solver
* Make a clear documenation of the solver
